 static String name;   /*If we use 'static' to the 'name' Variable, it means name variable is common to all objects*/
 
 obj1.name="phone"; /*Here we are trying to assign 'phone' to name variable*/
			
			/*Here we are trying to assign 'phone' to name variable which is present in obj1, But it changed value to obj2 as well*/
			
		Why because static variable will be Shared by all the objects.
		
		Basically will not be having individual static variable for every object.
		
		We have a common variable which will be used by all objects. 
		
								name

							|	       |
						--------     ---------
						  101          103
						-------      --------
						
		Here we have common variable, which will be used by all the objects.
		
		If we change the value of "name" it will effect the all objects.					
		
		
		// Refer Demo2
		
		name is the static variable and it is common for all the objects and that's why we can call 'name' with the class name it self.
		
		In Non static method we can use static variable there is no horm.
