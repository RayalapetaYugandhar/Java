 * 
 *  If we want to print something in multiple times then will go for LOOPS.  
 * 
 * 		LOOPS in java --->
 * 							1. while loop
 * 							2. do while loop
 * 							3. for loop
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE:-
 * 		WHich loop we need to use
 * 
 * 1. for loop
 * 
 * 		If you know how many iterations you have to perform.
 *  
 * 2. while loop
 * 		For reading a file will go for while loop.
 * 
 * 3. do while loop
 * 		Even if the condition is false, still you want to print something then will use do while loop 
 *
 *
 *
 *			-->> In generally we use 'for loop'
 *			-->> For reading a file then we use 'while loop'
 *			-->> rarely we use 'do while loop'
 *
 *
 *(Q). Can we use for loop as a while loop?
 *		a). Yes, We can 
 *
 *		EX:-
 *			int i =1
 *			for(;i<=5;)
 *			{
 *			System.out.println("Day" + i);
 *			}
 *
 *	Output:
 *		Day1
	 *  Day2
	 *  Day3
	 *  Day4
	 *  Day5
 *
 *
 *Note:-
 *	for(int i=1; i<=5; i++)
 *	{
 *		System.out.println("Day" +i);
 *	}
 *
 *	First it will check this condition i=1; i<=5, Next it will print the value.. Then it will increase i++ the value in next condition.
