	String Terms:-
		
		Mutable String -->>Change
		Immutable String -->>UnChange
		
	Basically Strings are Immutable, Once you create the data then it is Unchangeble 
	
	
	Q). What if you want mutable change ?
			
			We have 2 different classes in java to use instead of string we can use
			
				1. String Buffer
				2. String Bulder 
				
		** Difference between String Buffer and String Bulder 
			
				> String Buffer is thead safe
				
				> String bulder is not a thread safe
				
				> All methods are same in both 
				
				
-->> Lenght and capacity both are two different things
