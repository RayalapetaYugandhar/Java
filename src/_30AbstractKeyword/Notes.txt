The need for abstract in Java (or any OOP language) arises from the principle of abstraction—hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionality. Here’s why it’s important:

✅ 1. Enforces a Common Contract

An abstract class defines methods that subclasses must implement.
Example: Computer declares code(). Every subclass (Laptop, Desktop) must provide its own version.
This ensures consistency across different implementations.


✅ 2. Promotes Polymorphism

You can write code that works on the abstract type, not concrete classes.
Example: Developer.devApp(Computer machine) works for Laptop, Desktop, or any future Computer type without changing the method.


✅ 3. Supports Code Reusability

Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods.
Common logic can be implemented once in the abstract class and reused by subclasses.


✅ 4. Enables Loose Coupling

The client (e.g., Developer) depends on the abstract class, not specific implementations.
This makes the system flexible and easier to maintain or extend.


✅ 5. Real-World Analogy
Think of an abstract class as a blueprint:

A “Vehicle” abstract class says every vehicle must have start() and stop().
Car, Bike, Truck implement these differently, but the contract remains the same.
