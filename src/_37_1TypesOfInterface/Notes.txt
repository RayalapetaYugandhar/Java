There are 3 types of interface we have 
    1. Normal interface
    2. Functional interface
    3. Marker interface

1. Normal Interface

    An interface that can have any number of abstract methods.
    Used to define a contract that implementing classes must follow.


    interface Vehicle {  //interface
        void start();    // implicitly public and abstract //abstract method public abstract void start();
        void stop();
    }

    So you don’t need to explicitly write public abstract in an interface method declaration. 

2. Functional Interface

    An interface that has exactly one abstract method.
    Can have default and static methods.
    Used heavily in Lambda Expressions and Streams API.
    Annotated with @FunctionalInterface (optional but recommended).


    @FunctionalInterface
    interface Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b);
    }

    Calculator calc = (a, b) -> a + b;    

3. Marker Interface

    An interface with no methods (empty interface).
    Used to mark or tag a class for special behavior.
    Example: Serializable, Cloneable.

    interface Marker {

    }
    class MyClass implements Marker {}

    A Marker Interface in Java is an interface that does not declare any methods or fields. 
    Its sole purpose is to mark or tag a class so that the JVM or frameworks can recognize that the class has a special property or should be treated differently.
