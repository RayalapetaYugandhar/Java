parent class is Calculator class
Child class is AdvanceCalculator class

Inheritance is the process of child class can inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of parent class.

child class can have its own methods and properties in addition to the parent class methods and properties.

here parent class have add and sub methods
here child class have mul and div methods in addition to parent class methods add and sub

with help of "extends" keyword we can inherit the parent class methods and properties in child class


first we have parent class Calculator
then we have child class AdvanceCalculator
we are inheriting the parent class Calculator in child class AdvanceCalculator, with help of "extends" keyword
then we have created reference variable of child class AdvanceCalculator in main method of Calc class
then we are able to access both parent class methods and child class methods with help of child class reference variable
and we have assigned the return values of methods to different variables and printed them



child class or sub class - both are same

In inheritance even if we don't have java file of parent class still we can inherit the parent class methods and properties in child class
if we have java file of parent class then also we can inherit the parent class methods and properties in child class

                
                    Q. How it will work ?
                        
                          Parent 
                            ^
                        Child or Sub                     // single level inheritance
                            ^ 
                    Grand Child or Sub Child             // Multilevel Inheritance
                            ^
                Great Grand Child or Sub Sub Child        // Multilevel Inheritance
                        
  >> we can achieve multilevel inheritance with help of inheritance...
  >> we can achieve hierarchical inheritance with help of inheritance

With help of inheritance we can achieve code reusability
we are reusing the parent class methods in child class with help of extends keyword

we can achieve method overriding with help of inheritance
we can achieve runtime polymorphism with help of inheritance
