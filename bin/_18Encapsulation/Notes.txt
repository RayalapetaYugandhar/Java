Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts.
The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.  
To achieve encapsulation in Java:
1. Declare the variables of a class as private.
2. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

Example:

class Person {
  private String name; // private = restricted access   
  private int age;   
  // Getter
  public String getName() {  
    return name;
  }
  // Setter  
  public void setName(String newName) {  
    this.name = newName; 
  }
  // Getter  
  public int getAge() {  
    return age;          
  }
  // Setter
  public void setAge(int newAge) {
    if (newAge > 0) { // age cannot be negative
      this.age = newAge;     
    }     
  }
}

In the above example, the variables name and age are declared as private.    
They can only be accessed and modified through the public getter and setter methods.
Benefits of Encapsulation:
1. Control: You can control the way data is accessed or modified.
2. Flexibility: You can change one part of the code without affecting other parts.
3. Maintainability: It is easier to maintain and modify code when it is encapsulated.
4. Security: It helps to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.        
Note: In real-world applications, encapsulation is widely used to protect data and ensure that it is accessed and modified in a controlled manner.
