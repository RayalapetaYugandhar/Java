// if you have all abstract methods in a class, then instead of craete a class, we can create a interface 
// To achieve interface we have to use "implements" in child class

// To inherit the feature and properties present in parent class we use "extends" keyword in child class

// To inherit the feature and properties present in interface we use "implements" keyword in child class

//If we are implementing the child class with the reference of parent, then we have to define all methods present in parent 

//If you wright any public method with body in interface it won't allow, you can write default, static, private methods with body


----------------------------------------

The main use of an interface in Java is to define a contract or blueprint for classes without specifying how the methods should be implemented. Here’s why interfaces are important:

✅ Uses of Interfaces


Achieve Abstraction

    Interfaces allow you to define what a class should do, not how it should do it.
    Example: interface Vehicle { void start(); }
    Any class implementing Vehicle must provide its own start() logic.



Support Multiple Inheritance

    Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes (to avoid ambiguity), but a class can implement multiple interfaces.
    Example:

        interface A { void methodA(); }
        interface B { void methodB(); }
        class C implements A, B {
            public    public void methodA() { ... }
            public void methodB() { ... }
        }
Loose Coupling

    Code depends on interfaces, not concrete classes. This makes systems more flexible and easier to maintain.
    Example:
        
        A obj = new B();  // Program to interface, not implementation

Polymorphism

    Interfaces enable polymorphic behavior. You can refer to different implementations using the same interface type.
    Example:


    A obj = new B();
    obj.show();  // Calls B's implementation

Standardization

    Interfaces define a common set of methods that multiple classes can implement, ensuring consistency.
    Example: Comparable, Runnable, Serializable are standard Java interfaces.



API Design

    Interfaces are widely used in frameworks and libraries to define contracts for users without exposing internal details.
    Example: JDBC uses interfaces like Connection, Statement.




✅ Real-world examples

    Java Collections Framework: List, Set, Map are interfaces. Classes like ArrayList, HashSet implement them.
    Event Handling: ActionListener in Swing or Android.
    Threading: Runnable interface for defining tasks.


🔍 Key Points

    All methods in an interface are public and abstract by default (except default and static methods introduced in Java 8).
    All variables are public static final (constants).
    Interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated.
