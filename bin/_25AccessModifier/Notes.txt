✅ Explanation by Scenario:


Same Class

All modifiers (private, protected, public, default) are accessible because you're inside the same class.



Same Package – Subclass

    private: ❌ Not accessible outside its own class.
    protected: ✅ Accessible because subclass inherits it.
    public: ✅ Accessible everywhere.
    default: ✅ Accessible because it's in the same package.



Same Package – Non-subclass

    private: ❌ Not accessible.
    protected: ✅ Accessible because same package.
    public: ✅ Accessible everywhere.
    default: ✅ Accessible because same package.



Different Package – Subclass

    private: ❌ Not accessible.
    protected: ✅ Accessible because subclass inherits it (even if in different package).
    public: ✅ Accessible everywhere.
    default: ❌ Not accessible because different package.



Different Package – Non-subclass

    private: ❌ Not accessible.
    protected: ❌ Not accessible (only works for subclasses).
    public: ✅ Accessible everywhere.
    default: ❌ Not accessible because different package.




✅ Key Points:

    private → Only inside the same class.
    default → Only inside the same package.
    protected → Same package + subclasses (even in different packages).
    public → Everywhere.
