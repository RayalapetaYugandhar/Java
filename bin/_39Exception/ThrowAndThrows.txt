✅ Difference from throw:

throw = actually throwing the exception inside the method.
throws = declaring in the method signature that the method might throw exceptions.


Throw - Throw keyword is used to throw the exception with in the method

Thows - “I’m not handling this exception here. I’ll just declare throws ClassNotFoundException so whoever calls me must handle it.”

        Here we don't have "checkingclass", still we are trying to get the class in show method,
        what show method is saying, i don't handle exception here i will just throws the exception to main, 
        then main will handle exception with the help of try catch block

throws is the Java keyword used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw certain exceptions.

Ducking is the concept of not handling the exception in the current method and letting it propagate up the call stack (usually by using throws).
