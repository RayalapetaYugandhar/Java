✅ What is an Exception?
An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. It occurs during runtime and indicates an error or unexpected condition.

✅ Types of Exceptions


Checked Exceptions

Checked at compile-time.
Must be handled using try-catch or declared with throws.
Examples: IOException, SQLException.



Unchecked Exceptions

Occur at runtime.
Subclasses of RuntimeException.
Examples: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.



Errors

Serious problems, usually not recoverable.
Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError.


✅ Exception Hierarchy
Throwable
   ├── Exception
   │     ├── Checked Exceptions
   │     └── Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeException)
   └── Error
         ├── OutOfMemoryError
         ├── StackOverflowError
         └── InternalError


✅ Handling Exceptions

    try-catch block


    try {
        int a =     int a = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
    }


    finally block
    Always executes (used for cleanup).
    throws keyword
    Declares exceptions in method signature.
    throw keyword
    Used to explicitly throw an exception.


✅ Common Exception Classes

    ArithmeticException
    NullPointerException
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    IOException
    ClassNotFoundException


✅ Best Practices

    Catch specific exceptions, not Exception blindly.
    Avoid swallowing exceptions (always log or handle properly).
    Use custom exceptions for business logic errors.

--------------------
Throw - Throw keyword is used to throw the exception with in the method

Thows - “I’m not handling this exception here. I’ll just declare throws ClassNotFoundException so whoever calls me must handle it.”

        Here we don't have "checkingclass", still we are trying to get the class in show method,
        what show method is saying, i don't handle exception here i will just throws the exception to main, 
        then main will handle exception with the help of try catch block

throws is the Java keyword used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw certain exceptions.

Ducking is the concept of not handling the exception in the current method and letting it propagate up the call stack (usually by using throws).
